# üßπ `fuzzypath`

Quick & dirty fuzzy path comparison

# Comparison rules

* ‚úÖ Case insensitive
* ‚úÖ Backslashes are normalized to forward slashes
* ‚úÖ Trailing slashes are removed, except for root slash (for absolute POSIX paths)
* ‚úÖ Repeating slashes are normalized to a single slash
* ‚ùå Comparing a Windows path with a POSIX path will not work if either is absolute (Windows paths with a drive letter, POSIX paths with a preceeding slash)
* ‚ùå Comparing a Windows UNC path will not work with any POSIX path

# Usage

Add `fuzzypath` to your Cargo.toml dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
fuzzypath = "1"
```

# Serde

To enable Serde serialization and deserialization, use the crate feature `serde`

```toml
[dependencies]
fuzzypath = { version = "1", features = ["serde"] }
```
